# Game
This code will solve the 3D Squares game by DaMert Company

# Strategy
The solution I coded uses recursion to find the solution.
We start with the empty square and the 9 tiles.
At each step, we generate all the possible options.
For example the first step generates 36 different positions (9 tiles + 4 rotations for each)
